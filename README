2DRM (Davromaniak's Debian Repository Manager) - A script for Debian/Ubuntu repository admins
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning
-------
Now, 2drm is at a very early stage of development, even if I develop it since 2010, he was a quick and dirty script before the creation of the github project and the first commit.

The first commit includes a big amount of clean fixes and pebkac-proof mecanisms, but 2drm is still not stable.

About
-----
Script to manage a Debian/Ubuntu repository with and generate a website presenting the repository

Why this name
-------------
It's a pun between my nickname and the DRM technology, which is dumb and useless.

Requirements
------------
- bash
- wget
- grep
- sed
- getopt
- sqlite3
- reprepro
- dpkg-scanpackages
- apt-ftparchive
- gpg (if you want the repository to be signed)

Installation
------------
- Give the correct rights in order to execute the 2drm script.

Usage
-----
- First run : 
-- Generate the repository configuration using ./2drm --root="/folder/repo" --configure
-- copy the css folder into the repository root folder
- Add package : 
-- ./2drm --root="/folder/repo" --dist="squeeze" --component="main" --packages="/tmp/torepo/*.deb"
- Remove package :
-- TODO
